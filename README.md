**i'm not sure why but you need to source libpath.sh otherwise it won't compile**

a program that translates english into animalese in real-time

you can use it for streaming video games on the internet

you could also use it for a video ransom note or something if you want

for legal reasons you shouldn't do that but it would be really funny if you did
